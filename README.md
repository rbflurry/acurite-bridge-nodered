## Acutrite bridge with nodered 
With the help of https://github.com/billfor/acurite-bridge I was able to recreate the hub-bridge to get my acurite 5-1 weather station to upload to weatherundgerground.


### Requirements
- Node Red running and able to listen on port 80 (either start nodered on port 80 or use ngnix/apache to redirect 80 to nodered port 1880)
- dnsmasq or another way to hijack DNS responses for hupapi.myacurite.com
- Station ID and PW from Weather Underground

### Installation
- Import Flow into Nodered
- edit "add ID and PW" node to your ID and pw from your PWS profile on weatherunderground.com
