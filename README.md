## Acutrite smartHUB bridge with nodered 
With the help of https://github.com/billfor/acurite-bridge I was able to recreate the hub-bridge to get my acurite 5-1 weather station to upload to weatherundgerground.


### Requirements
- Node Red running and able to listen on port 80 (either start nodered on port 80 or use ngnix/apache to redirect 80 to nodered port 1880)
- dnsmasq or another way to hijack DNS responses for hupapi.myacurite.com
- Bridge Device ID (from the bottom of your smartHUB)
- Station ID and KEY from Weather Underground

### Installation
- Import Flow into Nodered
- edit "check device ID, add ID and Key" node to your PWS ID and Key from your device profile on weatherunderground.com

### How it Works
- The smartHUB sends two different status messages about 20 seconds apart to hubapi.myacurite.com/weatherstation/updateweatherstation
- The major difference is one contains temp and humitidy the other containes wind direction and rain accumulation.
- Using DNS make your hub send these requests to your node-red instance.
- The flow will listen for incoming messages and check to make sure they are from your smartHUB.
- IF the message is from your smartHub it will update the ID and Key for your weatherunderground account.
- It will store messages and combine them sending only one update to weather underground per minute.
- The flow also calculates and adds the Dew Point to the payload sent to weatherunderground.
- The flow will then return the needed response json to the smartHUB.

### Sensor Data
- Temperature
- Humiitidy
- Barmin
- Wind Direction
- Wind Speed
- Dew Point
- Rain
- Daily Rain
